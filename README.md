# PantryRaider
Android Application that allows users to search recipes based on the items in their pantry.

Hi everyone! This is a project for the class CSE 110 - Software Engineering. In this class, people gathered into teams
to create an application based on an idea the team wanted to pursue. My team, Supreme Meals For Heros, wanted to create a recipe app that used
ingredients you already had to find recipes that you could readily make. There were other features to this app as well such as
dietary preference filters, personal account creation, recipe search, and others.

### Currently, this app is decommissioned because the Firebase database account has been deleted and the recipe server is no longer running.

I personally contributed to the Ingredients and Pantry portions of the app.

In this class, we also had to create documentation for our application.

I authored these documents:
